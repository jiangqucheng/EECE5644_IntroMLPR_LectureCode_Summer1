# EECE5644_IntroMLPR_LectureCode_Summer1

Code to complement lectures of the _"EECE 5644: Introduction to Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition"_ course taught at Northeastern University.

Please contact the lecturer **Mark Zolotas** about any questions concering the repository: m.zolotas@northeastern.edu

## Directory Layout

- `modules` contains a library of Python modules for basic machine learning functions.
- `notebooks` consists of Jupyter Notebook files that walk through examples with both mathematical formulation and programming implementation.
- `scripts` are example Python programs that test the functionality provided by the `modules` library.
- `matlab` contains Matlab code to complement the Python implementation in this repository. Developed by previous professor, Deniz Erdogmus.

## Getting Started

I make use of Jupyter Notebooks for many of the in-class demonstrations. This is basically a Python web interface that allows me to combine written formulas/notes with code and run it in a sequential fashion. My environment is set up using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), which I highly recommend for hosting applications like Jupyter within your Python [environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#:~:text=A%20virtual%20environment%20is%20a,part%20of%20your%20operating%20system.).

Ofcourse, you can also look through the Notebooks without running the code. Or you can directly import the code aspects into whatever Python IDE is of your preference. I usually recommend these two:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

Both are great so take your pick!

Lastly, my Python environment can be installed directly using `pip` as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
